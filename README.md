# odin-recipes

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time I’ve finished. Not unless you’re into brutalist web design, that is.

Added three recipes, each one with a Title, an image of the dish, a description,
the ingrediends, the steps you need to follow, and a note on two of them.
