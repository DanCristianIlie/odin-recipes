		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			Traditional cheesy, greasy pizza isn't great for our health. This clean
			alternative tastes better and satisfies those weekend cravings.
		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 head cauliflower, cut into florets</li>
			<li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
			<li>1 cup almond flour</li>
			<li>1½ tbsp coconut flour</li>
			<li>½ tsp ground cumin</li>
			<li>1½ tbsp olive oil</li>
			<li>1 handful mozzarella, shredded (optional)</li>
			<li>1½ tbsp fresh rosemary</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>For the toppings</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>2½ tbsp ricotta</li>
			<li>1 basket cherry tomato, halved</li>
			<li>½ eggplant, sliced</li>
			<li>2½ tbsp pesto</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				AdPreheat the oven to 180°C or 350°F. Line a large baking tray with
				baking paper.
			</li>
			<li>
				Place the cauliflower florets in a food processor, and blend until it
				forms a rice-like consistency. You can either steam the cauliflower
				first or use it raw; it works both ways. Alternately, use store-bought
				cauliflower rice.
			</li>
			<li>
				Place the cauliflower in a clean tea towel and squeeze out as much
				moisture as possible. Don't skip this step, as it's the key to making a
				crispy pizza base.
			</li>
			<li>
				In a mixing bowl, place the cauliflower, whisked eggs, almond meal,
				coconut flour, cumin or curry powder, olive oil, mozzarella (if using),
				rosemary plus salt and pepper. Press the mixture firmly.
			</li>
			<li>
				Place the cauliflower mixture in the center of the tray. Place a sheet
				of baking paper on top and use your palms or a rolling pin to flatten it
				into a circle. Top the pizza with pesto, ricotta, eggplant and baby
				tomatoes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bake for 35-40 minutes or until the base is firm and slightly browned.
				You may also want to add more seasoning, plus some extra olive oil.
			</li>
			<li>
				Take the pizza out of the oven and allow it to cool for a few minutes
				before slicing.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Notes</h2>
		<p>
			To make this recipe vegan: Replace the egg with a chia egg.
			<br />
			Add 1 tbsp chia plus 3 tbsp water in a small bowl and stir to combine.
			Allow to sit for 10 minutes. Top with your favorite nut cheese.
